# Wine-Qualirt-Prediction-ML
We start by loading the DATASET and then using the .head and .describe commands to get statistical information about our DATASET. Then, with .info, we get some extra information about the attributes. We continue by processing the DATASET. We fill all Null variables with a value of 0 and then check it. Then, with the help of a Box plot, we check for outliers and with a Dist plot we examine the distribution of all numeric data and see that there is a Bell curve. Next, with the countplot, we count the values of each type of wine (white/red). With the countplot of quality, we see the quality of the wine and how the Middle classes have the most results, which helps more for the outcome. Then, with the correlation matrix table, we see the correlation between 2 variables. In the end, we split the DATASET into type and quality to find the desired result. With SMOTE, we try to balance the class ratio, which we manage to do because we see that they all have the same upper value. We start within a function to train the model and perform cross-validation. And we reach the point where we try with various functions to get a reliable result for the accuracy (classification model, decision tree, random forest, and finally some extra trees).
